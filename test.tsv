In
fact
told
recently
need
supplemental

He
denies

In

He

I

also

His

Assessment
This

I
therefore
think
stress

required

She
also

I
would
like
evaluate

Plan
I
therefore
organized

stress
test
assess
myocardial
ischemia
cardiovascular
risk

I
also
asked
start
small

reducing
perioperative

well
treating
blood
pressure
elevated

I
also
asked
fasting

lipid
test
today
assess

likely
would
benefit
lipid
lowering
therapy

I
plan
evaluate
approximately
month
operation
manage
long

I
let
know
results
stress
test
become
available

Thank
allowing

Dear
Harry
Yair

My

As
know
52

age

Her
cardiovascular
risk

include

diabetes
treated
metformin
Glyburide
hypertension
hyperlipidemia
former

She
spends

time
caring
partially

husband

She
known
impressive
history
peripheral

disease

She
undergone
bilateral
leg
revascularizations

On

initially

She
states

By
last
spring

year

rather
limiting
claudication

She
says

past

Importantly

last
October
documenting

artery
occlusion
length
thereof
bring
films
patent
albeit
small
reconstituted
knee
popliteal
artery
decent
runoff

Understandably
Dr
Adcock
reluctant
recommending
revascularizations

She
sought
opinion
regard

She
known
coronary
artery
disease
general
system
review
notable
prior
hospitalization

There

She

although

This
course
unhappy
situation

Further
attempts
surgical
revascularization
setting
greater
saphenous
veins
harvested
forth
really
justified
claudication
alone
since
result
anticipated
good

However
I
absolutely
ruling

I
would
suggest
following

Her
risk
factor
control
decent
certainly
stay
Lipitor
aspirin
Plavix

Since
problem
claudication
I
would
like
Yair
institute
Pletal
full
dosages
give
least
couple
months
say
adequate
trial
question
benefit

She
get
actual
arteriogram
October
study

If
seems
reasonable
right
superficial
femoral

long
attempt
percutaneous
recanalization
could
considered

I
get

My
thanks
